## 🔐 STEP 1: Add GitHub Secrets (REQUIRED - 2 minutes)

Your workflows need these 4 secrets to run. Add them now:

### Go to GitHub:
1. Open: https://github.com/bobinzuks/git-money-ideas/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"** for each secret below

### Add These 4 Secrets:

#### Secret 1: `GH_TOKEN`
- **Name:** `GH_TOKEN`
- **Value:** Your GitHub Personal Access Token
- **Get it:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
  1. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
  2. Name: `git-money-ideas-discovery`
  3. Select scope: ☑️ `public_repo`
  4. Click "Generate token"
  5. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

#### Secret 2: `EMAIL_FROM`
- **Name:** `EMAIL_FROM`
- **Value:** `bobinzuks@gmail.com` (or your email)

#### Secret 3: `EMAIL_TO`
- **Name:** `EMAIL_TO`
- **Value:** `bobinzuks@gmail.com` (where you want reports sent)

#### Secret 4: `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- **Name:** `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- **Value:** Your Gmail App Password (NOT your regular password!)
- **Get it:** https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
  1. Sign in to your Google account
  2. App name: `GitHub Actions`
  3. Click "Create"
  4. **COPY THE 16-CHARACTER PASSWORD**
  5. Paste it (with or without spaces, both work)

## 🧪 STEP 2: Test Your First Run (30 seconds)

Once secrets are added, trigger a test run:

### Option A: Via GitHub Website
1. Go to: https://github.com/bobinzuks/git-money-ideas/actions
2. Click **"Continuous Discovery & Training"** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. Click **"Run workflow"** (green button)
5. Wait ~2 minutes, then refresh the page

### Option B: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh workflow run continuous-discovery.yml
```

## 📧 STEP 3: Check Your Email! (15 minutes)

The workflow takes ~10-15 minutes to complete:

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Workflow Failed?

**Check logs:**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click the failed run
3. Click the failed job (red X)
4. Read error message

**Common issues:**
- Missing secret → Add all 4 secrets
- Wrong GitHub token scope → Needs `public_repo`
- Wrong email password → Use App Password, not regular password
- SMTP blocked → Gmail might need "less secure apps" enabled

### ❌ No Email Received?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Spam folder
2. ✅ All secrets are correct (especially EMAIL_PASSWORD)
3. ✅ Workflow completed successfully (green checkmark)
4. ✅ Check workflow logs for email sending step

**Gmail Users:**
- Must use App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- Regular password won't work
- 2FA password won't work

### ❌ Database Not Updating?

**Check:**
- Look for commits from `github-actions[bot]`
- Workflow has write permissions (Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write)
