## 🧠 Training Objectives

### 1. WASM Discovery Engine Training

**Input Data:** 42 live discoveries from `live_discoveries_20251024_105203.json`

**Training Tasks:**
- Extract features: stars, category, language, topics, description
- Build embeddings for similarity matching
- Train on successful monetization patterns
- Compile to WASM for browser execution

**Success Metrics:**
- Similarity search <50ms per query
- 80%+ accuracy in finding related repos
- Runs entirely client-side in browser

### 2. AgentDB Fast-Money Detection

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Repos needing real-time data → AgentDB candidate
- Multi-user collaboration tools → AgentDB integration
- Analytics/monitoring platforms → AgentDB storage layer
- AI/LLM applications → AgentDB for context/memory

**Training Examples:**

| Repo Type | AgentDB Integration | Fast Money Reason |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Security Dashboard | Store attack patterns, threat intel | Enterprise SaaS: $500-5K/mo |
| DevOps Monitoring | Real-time metrics, alert history | Team license: $100-1K/mo |
| AI Chatbot Platform | Conversation memory, user context | API usage: $0.01-1/request |
| Developer Analytics | Code metrics, team insights | Freemium: $50-500/mo |

**Success Metrics:**
- Identify 10+ AgentDB opportunities from 42 repos
- Predict revenue uplift from integration
- Time-to-revenue < 30 days

## 🎲 Gamification Implementation

### Level 1: Basic Discovery (You Are Here)
```python
# Current: 42 repos discovered
# Goal: Find similar repos for each

for repo in discovered_repos:
    similar = find_similar_repos(repo)
    score = rate_monetization(similar)

    if score > 7.0:
        print(f"🎉 +50 points! Fast-money opportunity!")
```

### Level 2: Pattern Learning
```python
# Train on successful patterns
patterns = extract_patterns(high_scoring_repos)
agentdb_opportunities = identify_agentdb_fit(patterns)

for opp in agentdb_opportunities:
    revenue_boost = calculate_agentdb_multiplier(opp)
    print(f"💰 +100 points! ${revenue_boost}K faster with AgentDB")
```

### Level 3: Infinite Scaling
```rust
// WASM engine for millions of repos
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn discover_at_scale(query: &str) -> Vec<Opportunity> {
    // Runs in browser, no API limits
    // Process 1000s of repos per second
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start: Training Mode

### Step 1: Train on 42 Discoveries

```bash
# Run discovery (already done)
./discover_live_repos.py

# Train vector DB
python3 train_simple_vector_db.py

# Score: +210 points (42 repos × 5 pts)
```

### Step 2: Find Similar Repos

```python
# For each of 42 repos, find 10 similar ones
# Total: 420 new discoveries
# Score: +4,200 points (420 × 10 pts)

db = SimpleVectorDB("opportunity_vectors.db")

for repo in discovered_repos:
    embedding = generate_embedding(repo)
    similar = db.search(embedding, top_k=10)

    for match in similar:
        print(f"Found: {match.metadata['project']} (Similarity: {match.score})")
```

### Step 3: AgentDB Integration Detection

```python
# Identify repos that would benefit from AgentDB
# Score: +100 points per AgentDB opportunity

agentdb_keywords = [
    'real-time', 'collaborative', 'multi-user',
    'analytics', 'monitoring', 'dashboard',
    'chat', 'conversation', 'memory',
    'context', 'history', 'state'
]

for repo in discovered_repos:
    if matches_agentdb_pattern(repo):
        revenue_without = estimate_revenue(repo)
        revenue_with_agentdb = revenue_without * 2.5

        print(f"🎯 AgentDB Opportunity!")
        print(f"   Revenue boost: {revenue_with_agentdb - revenue_without}K")
        print(f"   +100 points!")
```
