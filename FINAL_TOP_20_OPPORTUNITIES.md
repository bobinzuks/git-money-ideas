## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Technical Risks
1. **Start with MVP:** Launch in 4-12 weeks max, validate quickly
2. **Leverage Existing Tools:** Use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, don't build LLMs
3. **Focus on One Database:** PostgreSQL first, expand later
4. **Serverless Architecture:** Scale automatically, reduce infrastructure risk

### Market Risks
1. **Validate Before Building:** Pre-sell with landing page + waitlist (target: 100+ signups)
2. **Community-First:** Engage DB-GPT community (17K+ warm leads)
3. **Freemium Model:** Low-friction adoption, convert 2-5% to paid
4. **ProductHunt Launch:** Free distribution, viral potential

### Financial Risks
1. **Bootstrap Phase 1:** Use low-cost, high-speed projects first
2. **Reinvest Profits:** Fund Phase 2 with Phase 1 revenue
3. **Usage-Based Pricing:** Revenue scales with customer value
4. **Annual Contracts:** Improve cash flow, reduce churn

### Execution Risks
1. **Focus on Quick Wins:** Don't spread too thin initially
2. **Hire Carefully:** Start with 1-2 developers, scale based on revenue
3. **Outsource Strategically:** Design, security audits, compliance
4. **Measure Everything:** Track conversion rates, churn, CAC, LTV
